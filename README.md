Heeeello, this is my second repo but this one is a information gathering tool, you'll need ubuntu(can download on windows too), kali linux or debian. You will need multiple dependencies for this, and if you're a bit new to like ubuntu and stuff here's the command to install everything: sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y curl dnsutils nmap whois traceroute openssl. | 
and then, if you want you can install this as a zip file, and then just put the "main.sh" wherever you'd like, and then if you're using Ubuntu on WSL (windows subystem for linux), you run this command: cd /mnt/yourpath, and then "chmod +x main.sh" and finally, ./main.sh to run the file.
