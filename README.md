# Abyssal
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Heeeello, this is my second repo but this one is a information gathering tool, you'll need ubuntu(can download on windows too), kali linux or debian. 

You will need multiple dependencies for this, and if you're a bit new to like ubuntu and stuff here's the command to install everything: sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y curl dnsutils nmap whois traceroute openssl. 

Then, if you want you can install this as a zip file, and then just put the "main.sh" wherever you'd like, and then if you're using Ubuntu on WSL (windows subystem for linux), you run this command: cd /mnt/yourpath, and then "chmod +x main.sh" and finally, ./main.sh to run the file. 

To clone this in Ubuntu or whatever you use if you don't know how, this is how: git clone https://github.com/yyyyeattwer/Abyssal.git 

| then, once it clones, do this: cd Abyssal 

| then chmod +x main.sh |

and finally, ./main.sh

I know this isn't as good as some of the other ones out there, but it's my first time making stuff like this so bear with me. ðŸ˜­
