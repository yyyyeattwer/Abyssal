# Abyssal
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Heeeello, this is my second repo but this one is a information gathering tool, you'll need ubuntu(can download on windows too), kali linux or debian. 

You will need multiple dependencies for this, and if you're a bit new to like ubuntu and stuff here's the command to install everything: sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y curl dnsutils nmap whois traceroute openssl. 

Then, if you want you can install this as a zip file, and then just put the "main.sh" wherever you'd like, and then if you're using Ubuntu on WSL (windows subystem for linux), you run this command: cd /mnt/yourpath, and then "chmod +x main.sh" and finally, ./main.sh to run the file. 

To clone this in Ubuntu or whatever you use if you don't know how, this is how: git clone https://github.com/yyyyeattwer/Abyssal.git 

| then, once it clones, do this: cd Abyssal 

| then chmod +x main.sh |

and finally, ./main.sh

so, there was a bit of a problem with saving results if cloned from this git straight into ubuntu. so i'm hoping what i did fixes it, but what you wanna do before running anything and saving your results is running this command, i'm pretty sure you have to be inside the directory of "Abyssal" as well but im not 100% sure so I apologize. but anyways | mkdir -p "$HOME/Abyssal_Results"

I know this isn't as good as some of the other ones out there, but it's my first time making stuff like this so bear with me. ðŸ˜­
